    "- Contestants are given six random integer numbers with range 1 - 100 (inclusive). \n",
    "- A random target integer number between 101 and 999 is generated. \n",
    "- Contestants are expected to use a combination of the six integer numbers using plus, minus, divide and multiply operators to result in the generated random target number. \n",

    "## Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each number can only be used once.\n",
    "- Division operation can only be used when the divisor perfectly divides the quotient (i.e.) division results in an integer without remainder. \n",
    "- Subtraction operation can only be used when it will result in a positive integer. (?????)"
