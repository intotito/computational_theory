Final Year Project on Computational Theory

# Countdown Game

## About this Project
This project is aimed at solving the number round of the popular TV program Countdown. As part of the requirement for the award of Degree in 
Software Development this project was purposed to ensure that computing students can identify difficult computational problems in everyday 
life, define common models of computation, design computer programs using various variety of computational paradigms and analyze the complexity
of an algorithm. 

## Use of this Project

This project presents a naive solution to the Countdown game, by iteratively trying out every possible solution starting from trying out a 
single-digit solution to a six-digit solution. This however, could provide a basis for development of a computationally intelligent solution that 
can transverse the solution graph/tree using well thought out heuristics to achieve a better solution. 

## Run Application

To run the Countdown Game project, follow these steps:

### Local Machine
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies using `pip install numpy matplotlib`
- Open the Jupyter Notebook in your local environment.
- Run the Notebook (`project.ipynb`) cells to execute the project.
- Provide the input numbers and target number, and the program will attempt to find a solution.
### Google Colab

</a>

### Get Started

To test this application, run all the cells to execute the project then on the last executable block change the values of the parameters to the 
`solve_numbers` function as needed and then run the cell block to evaluate the inputs. Results are printed to the output with the time taken to 
evaluate a solution (if one exists).
